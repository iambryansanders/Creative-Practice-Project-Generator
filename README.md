Throughout the month of September, I have been trying to make content everyday - it has been tough. My only constraint was that I had to complete the project and release it within one hour. I found very shortly that my work was getting very similar to each other - so I created this. 
Using very basic javascript, brief CSS, and a few variables I was able to create this generator. All objects are stored in arrays.
